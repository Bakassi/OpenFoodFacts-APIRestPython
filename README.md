### How to use it?

Simple filter : `/products?origins=United Kingdom` <br/>
Complex filter : `/products?nutrition_grade_fr=a&origins=United Kingdom` <br/>
For arrays, a “.” will be used as a separator like so : `/products?nutrient_levels.salt=low`
Searchs can be inexact like :`/products?ingredients_text=beef`<br/>
It will retrieve tags like “beef braising steak”, “beef steak”...

/!\ By default the objects will be sorted by `created_t` in order to have the most important objects first

`/products/brands`             | If you want to know how many brands there are in the list you have just to do a request like that : `/products/brands?count=1`. If you want to query brands, to do for example an autocomplete field in ajax, query the API like : `/products/brands?query=Auch` or `/products/brands?query=Sains`. Add `...&count=1` to get the number of rows.

Add `...&count=1` to get the number of rows.
